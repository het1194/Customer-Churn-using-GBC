# Customer-Churn-using-GBC
As part of my short ML internship at Afame Technologies, I implemented various machine learning models for customer churn prediction. 
This project demonstrates the deployment of a Gradient Boosting Classifier (GBC) model using the PyCaret library features

## Methodology
* Create a new project folder and paste the downloaded dataset
* In the same folder, run the EDA jupyter notebook to study the data
* Next, run the GBC model notebook to train and test the model

**Note**: This project was deployed for learning purposes and the model hasn't been deployed in real time systems
